# Harmonica

**Forget forms, start conversations.**

Harmonica is an open-source platform for AI-facilitated deliberation. Instead of collecting scattered survey responses, Harmonica lets participants engage in structured conversations that surface the *why* behind their views — then synthesizes collective insights automatically.

Built for communities, governance researchers, and anyone who needs to make sense of what a group actually thinks.

## Projects

| Repository | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [harmonica-web-app](https://github.com/harmonicabot/harmonica-web-app) | Main platform — create sessions, facilitate conversations, analyze results | Active |
| [avatar-sdk](https://github.com/harmonicabot/avatar-sdk) | Knowledge avatars that represent expert perspectives in group discussions | Planned |
| [harmonica-mcp](https://github.com/harmonicabot/harmonica-mcp) | MCP server for AI agent access to Harmonica sessions | Planned |

## How It Works

1. **Create** a deliberation session with your question
2. **Share** the link — participants join async, on their own time
3. **Converse** — an AI facilitator guides each participant through a structured dialogue
4. **Synthesize** — Harmonica analyzes all conversations and produces a collective summary

No scheduling. No moderator bottleneck. Participants talk when it suits them, and the platform does the sensemaking.

## Ecosystem

Harmonica is part of a broader effort around computational democracy and collective intelligence:

- **[Metagov](https://metagov.org)** — governance research collaboration
- **[Open Facilitation Library](https://github.com/harmonicabot/harmonica-web-app/tree/main/OFL)** — reusable facilitation patterns
- **gov/acc** — accelerating governance innovation through open tooling

## Community-Funded Open Source

Harmonica is community-funded through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/harmonica) — no VC, no strings. Contributions, feedback, and research collaborations welcome.
