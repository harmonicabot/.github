# Harmonica

**Forget forms, start conversations.**

Harmonica is an open-source platform for AI-facilitated deliberation. Instead of collecting scattered survey responses, Harmonica lets participants engage in structured conversations that surface the *why* behind their views — then synthesizes collective insights automatically.

Built for communities, governance researchers, and anyone who needs to make sense of what a group actually thinks.

## Projects

| Repository | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [harmonica-web-app](https://github.com/harmonicabot/harmonica-web-app) | Main platform — create sessions, facilitate conversations, analyze results | Active |
| [avatar-sdk](https://github.com/harmonicabot/avatar-sdk) | Knowledge avatars that represent expert perspectives in group discussions | Planned |
| [harmonica-mcp](https://github.com/harmonicabot/harmonica-mcp) | MCP server for AI agent access to Harmonica sessions | Planned |

## How It Works

1. **Create** a deliberation session with your question
2. **Share** the link — participants join async, on their own time
3. **Converse** — an AI facilitator guides each participant through a structured dialogue
4. **Synthesize** — Harmonica analyzes all conversations and produces a collective summary

No scheduling. No moderator bottleneck. Participants talk when it suits them, and the platform does the sensemaking.

## Ecosystem

Harmonica is part of a broader effort around computational democracy and collective intelligence:

- **[Metagov Interop](https://metagov.org/projects/interop)** — first cohort participant in the Interoperable Deliberative Tools program, working on shared standards for deliberation platforms
- **[Open Facilitation Library](https://github.com/Open-Facilitation-Library)** — reusable facilitation patterns
- **[gov/acc](https://metagov.github.io/gov-acc/)** — Harmonica serves as data collection tool for governance research in web3 communities, in collaboration with Metagov
- **[Newspeak House](https://newspeak.house/)** — the London civic tech fellowship where early research behind Harmonica took place; dean Edward Saperia helped shape the concept and design the first MVP

## Community-Funded Open Source

Harmonica is community-funded through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/harmonica) and [Giveth](https://giveth.io/project/harmonica-ai-agents-for-group-sensemaking) — no VC, no strings. Contributions, feedback, and research collaborations welcome.
